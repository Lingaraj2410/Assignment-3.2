# Problem Statement:

We have a dataset of sales of different TV sets across different locations.

Records look like:
Samsung|Optima|14|Madhya Pradesh|132401|14200

The fields are arranged like:
Company Name|Product Name|Size in inches|State|Pin Code|Price

There are some invalid records which contain 'NA' in either Company Name or Product Name.
Write a Map Reduce program to filter out the invalid records. Map only job will fit for this
context.

# Solution Code Path:

Assignment-3.2/FilterInvalidRows/src/org/acadgild/

I have attached the screenshots of program execution as well as the ouput file itself in the root of this repository.
